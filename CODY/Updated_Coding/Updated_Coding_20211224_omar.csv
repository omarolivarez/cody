"We will NOT be denied our RIGHT to eating our cheap/fake-arse Dennys, Applebees, and Red Robin, nor stop us from getting our hair did! The nerve of you Blue-State Ninnies!___I meant the companies. Where is all of this magical product they are producing going? Are Americans really buying all of this stuff when there are millions of jobless?___All of mine doubled. Apparently, ours were years of out of date as well. Some of mine were actually almost 3X.___Texas. I have asked around and from people in the know, and apparently the counties have been catching-up valuations across the board.___So, does it all come crashing down in our lifetimes, or does the government (and The Fed) just keep over-inflating things forever? I know The Fed has indicated they are willing to keep throwing money at the markets, and in fact, have actually been buying bonds of individual companies (has this ever been done before?), but eventually, someone ... maybe not us (our progeny or theirs) will have to pay the bills. Personally, I hope I am long-gone from this earth, because it is going to be batsh*t crazy around here, or they are just going to have to reset everything and start over.___I say, these are all sideshows. Watch your personal income, your personal buying-power, your future employment or business prospects.___That is truly great to hearI am happy for you and your success! Sadly, that is not the reality for many. Good times while it lasts.___I have been saying for years that we are in the collapse, but just like frogs in a pot, we havent really noticed the temperature rising. We are about at boiling.___It is looking really dire.___Yes, like Tesla. I think they are fine cars, and I have no interest for or against the company or leadership. However, the stock is so wildly out of proportion to earnings that it is laughable.___I am a small landlord (one rental house) and I am having to raise the rent (have staved-off raising it for 3 years) because property taxes and assessments for 2019 have gone through the roof.___Im convinced its rigged also ... no way all of these companies keep rising when everyone I know is either at home or not working. What are they producing and for who? But I guess that is for another sub.___Oh, but the Stock Market... (It is their god, not mine)",Male,White,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, really, the other racists think it was one way. Jesus, you're a lost cause. He even sucker punches her again while she is just standing there before he leaves. No comment on the other seven videos? Still waiting for the 100 videos of those marauding hordes of ""black block"" at every Trump rallies, btw. ___He punched first ya dingleberry, one on one against a woman. It's literally a video, so it's mind boggling to me that you somehow don't believe your own eyes. Nevermind that he could've just walked around them in the first place like other people were doing. I guess the other 7 videos of suckerpunching don't count either. ___What fucking universe do you leave in? They were peacefully protesting, he rammed through then punched her in the face. Nobody ""surrounded him"" or ""jabbed him with sticks and clubs"". It's a video, it's not a debate. Like, you're so committed to your nonsense that you refuse to even acknowledge reality. Wow. ___The fact that you think you just made a sensical argument shows that you're very dim. ___https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqOXUN0md0___> the hundreds of instances of violence by ""protesters"" yeah, I would be interested in seeing that. It might take a few million dollars and some CGI wizards though. ___> almost weekly event Seems like you should have video from about 100 different rallies then, rather than one incident in San Jose. If you want I can link you to Trump supporters punching people too. ___Yeah guys. See if they call themselves alt right bc they know association with the word Nazi is toxic, we need to respect and defend that nonsense label. Sure they talk about white grievance, white genocide and speak almost exclusively about minorities destroying western civilization but they aren't white supremacists bc they came up with a new word.___You, dipshit.___> Trump would go to a rally and mobs of masked black bloc thugs would assault random rally-goers. False. Your entire post is garbage. ___> Linda Sarsour advocates for Sharia Law a False. And even if it were true the women's march was not about that. This rally, its topics, speakers, and participants were very clearly about white supremacy. It wasn't a few bad apples. Your attempts to make them similar are laughable.___And even if it were true it doesn't change the fact that he is now a right wing Nazi.___He's not that smart. He's just actually a really shitty, stupid person. ___Maybe you should ask the white supremacists and nazis who universally saw his statements as a full throated endorsement of them. But I guess then you couldn't blame ""muh libruls"" like the dipshitty little snowflake you are. ___You don't. It's a made up distinction meant to make it equivalent.___fuck off, nazi.___Nazi punk, fuck off.",Male,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
"Oh. r/conspiracy posts. Yeah. *Backs away slowly*___Oh, I've been doing my small part to advocate for the removal of Confederate memorials for years. I get that you may not have seen anyone mention the problem before the last couple of weeks, but your perception is not reality. The issue of Confederate memorials has been ongoing for years. Decades, even. You certainly have an odd take on this: You blame us for the issue, blame us for trying to rectify it, misunderstand why we want to rectify it or how long people have been advocating for that correction, and present your whole stance with the assumption that your perception of the situation is 100% correct in all ways. You should work on that last part.___We aren't trying to delete history, we're trying to delete tributes to the darker parts of that history. It's not about forgetting, it's about remembering properly. Yes, we'll kids will still learn about the Civil War in school - and they'll also learn what about those events should be honored and celebrated, and what about those events should be remembered as a lesson of what not to repeat. Also, yo, non-American, why do you care about a purely American issue you clearly don't understand?___Wow, is this ever **not** about which side won or lost. This is about removing tributes to men who actively fought to continue the practice of slavery.___> I don't see why there would be Confederate statues anyway. Because in two separate periods in the 1900s, long after the war was ended, racial tensions grew particularly heightened. People who believe in segregation and racial inequality erected this statues in a form of government-sactioned (and often sponsored) protest against the ideas of racial equality during those times. We're in a other such period now. Only this time, the statues are coming down.___Ah, if only we had some form of institution where history could be collected and reviewed by anyone interested in learning ...___Then we'll just have the non-shooty bits? The tacticians, the drone pilots, the medics, the infrastructure specialists ..? No trying to knock any soldier. I respect their service. But you're basically saying that removing the racists from our armed forces will make our armed forces less violent, and I don't see how that's a bad thing.___Oh, don't worry, kiddo! We're not looking to remove your heritage as opportunists who fought for a capitalist elite hellbent on exercising their right to literally own people. We'll still teach kids all about just how awful and racist your heritage is!",nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

A sensible person would, but some people have been tearing down Thomas Jefferson statues and defacing Colonel Shaw's memorial.___Some people defaced the Colonel Shaw memorial FFS, I'm willing to bet Lincoln himself is the only one exempt from this stupidity.

"I agree. It is just that telling people that the south was racist, and it was, saying that the north fought against that, make it sometime sound like the north was fighting for human rights, they were not.___Stalin being the reason of two atomic bombs on Japan, so the US would not have to share the country like they did with Germany. And the racist propanda. You can add that to Irak, Vietnam, CIA's coup in central/south America... Bad Russian, Good American. Also the US helped the USSR (+ the UK) not the other way around. War is dirty, winner write hisrory. I do agree the statues need to go. I do not like statues but if you build some commemorating WWII winners, Sta!in will need to be there, otherwise you rewriting history.___Is a flag really needed? I mean city, state, country in my opinion is enough.___I agree the statues need to go. But only in US history books you learn that slavery was the casus belli of the American civil war. It is abolition was a (great) consequence of it. Lincoln: My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. And not saying that Lincoln promoted slavery, just saying the war was not about that.",nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
"> I really dont see how it would be viewed as any different than say trying to fly the isis flag Oh come on.

"Go on...___They don't belong in a museum, they should be scrapped. Nothing says southern heritage like celebrating treasonous snakes.___Good___Sherman did not develop or co-opt his own political movement to displace indians on own was the point. He was a General acting on orders from DC. Dont act trite. You know what I meant. As far as Manifest Destiny, that concept existed long before Sherman. This was official policy even during Antebellum. This was the reality of the time. As far it being fair or right to murder indians, no one ever said that. You seem to like trying to put those words into my mouth. Let's compare the US policies with other colonial / expansionist entities in the Western Hemisphere. Should we have handled it like the Spanish did? Or the Spanish and later French did in Mexico? Maybe the Portuguese in Brazil? There are no reservations or recognitions of indigenous peoples, save for Brazil, there were not negotiations, there were no protected areas Natives agreed to go per treaties. It was slavery, forced interbreeding, and wars of total extermination. Does that make the treaty system fair? No, it does not. Yet, it was a hell of a lot better than what other expansionist systems did to the local populations in those areas. You can knock Sherman for his actions in the indian wars, historical criticisms are fine. But hes not going anywhere, he cratered the CSA and did more than any other Union General to achieve the ultimate surrender of treasonous snakes. If you want my critique of Sherman, it was his willingness to use violence on civilians and to make them feel the war on their home turf. In that sense, he is the first modern general. Total war must be waged to win otherwise going to war is not worth sacrificing anything. I dont fault him for burning plantations, fault others who took his Total War strategy to new heights. He thought that this was the quickest way to end a war, and he was right about that, breaking civilian resolve is a key component in fighting wars; however, liberties taken by all warplanners since against civilians in global conflicts culminated in WW2 and humanity paid a terrible price. He didnt invent this concept to suppress natives or blacks, he did so to end a war that would free blacks from slavery and did so against white soldiers and civilians. Your echo chamber comments that Sherman is a white nationalist ring hollow. So, him attacking the buffalo was an extension of this policy, he did it to end the conflict as quickly as possible. If indians could not eat, their leaders will get back to the table and end the conflicts. Which is eventually what happened.___Sherman was not the planner or policy maker to take matters into his own hands. He was issued order by the government of the united states to do so after treaty negotiations had broken down at various points. We can argue the virtue of those political decisions all day long. Yet, that does not make him Hitler or Jeff Davis. Sherman thought whites were superior in his era? A though shared by almost everyone white. Yet, he also persecuted a very terrible military action to quickly end a war that would ultimately free slaves which he knew would be the end result. Ie. He fought and brutally to those whites in the south, to ensure the United States would endure. Those slaves would be set free, even if he didnt see them as equal. Big difference over the Confederates and groups like Nazis. He obviously believed in a greater good that could become the US. If he truly thought of himself as a white nationalist, he would have stated in the south at the onset of the civil war and accepted the commission and posting that was offered to him to stay. He was well respected by southern gentlemen during his time in Lousiana.___Both Roosevelt and Sherman did not implement or systematically plan for the beginnings of the removal of native americans. This policy of indian relations was in place before the US was the US. France, England, Spain, etc all dealt with the indians this way in north america. Big difference in your logic. I am also not shortchanging the fact many of these things are racisit in hindsight or morally inept. Yet? The argument is with traitors and racists that became traitors with open, armed rebellion that cost an estimated 1 million americans their lives in a protracted civil war. They wanted to END the experiment the Framers enacted, which offered protections, yes, not for all, but with foresight for future generations to fix what they couldn't. The racist traitors of the south wanted to end that and put in place a system to permanently trap other humans in bondage, forever. Therefore, by your logic, we should also just scrap the entire united states because the constitution allowed for slavery at one point. And we should just quit now because Indians were relocated, sometimes forcibly sometimes not. Sometimes by treaty and payments. Sometimes by war. The promise of America has always been to fix what the past could not. The Framers knew it to be true, yet they also knew their own limitations and they also knew they were men of their times and era. Not everything was possible to achieve at once. Its obviously easy to sit today and cherrypick people and events and label everything as bad. That's not reality. People existed in different eras and while many many many people, who were not traitors, had foibles, they existed in a time we do not. People that advocated and fought for systems to destroy the promies of a better future. Confererates and Nazis, deserve to be left on in the dustbins of history. Racist traitors deserve to be gone from history. Period.___They are in our history books as the traitors they were and the ultimate defeat they met. Lee. I'm a US soldier but I'm a Virginian first. Traitor. NBF another general. began the KKK to harrass carpetbaggers, reconstruction and ultimately, newly freed slaves. Another traitor that lost. I could go on and on.___Lol. Opinion. It's not opinion. The trash monuments of traitors have dates of erection. Most were put up in the 20th century. Idiot.___history favors the victors and neither one.of those men betrayed their nation. Hitler, not being a traitor to his nation is true, but he was a traitor to the human race. He was a historical loser after beginning a war of expansion and to create living space by eliminating undesirables and corralling millions into slave labor and extermination. Sound familiar? Both men you listed knew of the ultimate flaws of the nation and did their best, despite the flaws, to move the collective idea of the time of the United States. Criticisim of sherman vs indians could be made; yet, he said repeatedly that he is not presidential material or does he wish to fight indians, he preferred peace and prosperity in the west. His tactics versus the Indians were also not developed by him only to be used on Indians. He developed his scorched earth policy in the civil war first in the western campaign and then through Georgia on Confererates and white plantation owners. So, at the end of it, he viewed himself as a soldier given a task and he said War is Hell and the fastest way to end it was to make it total war, the more terrible it was, the sooner it would be over. To juxtapose his Indian War behavior as something new and ultimately racist is not an accurate critique of his tactics nor his application. Same reason Andrew Jackson is still on the right side of history even with all of his vitriol and moral errors. He saw the United States as a nation first and the problems within could eventually be solved later. BTW, eontneven bring up the trail of tears. It was ultimately Martin van Buren that enforced the treaty of Ecoche. And should he also, as an avowed abolitionist who battled congress repeatedly over slavery and its expansion, be tossed aside because of it? No, why? Because he wasn't a traitor. confederates were racists AND traitors. Down with the scrap. Period. You can critique historical figures all you want. Some of it is fair game. But NO Confederate deserves to be eulogized anywhere anymore at anytime. Why? Same reason as hitler; their cause was not just and no rationalization can ever be made as to why they began the conflict in the first place. The Conferderates and the Nazis and their small cadre of believers engulfed nations into conflicts that killed millions to keep and further systems that had no other purpose than for exploitation and soul crushing extermination. The confederates are traitors and deserve the ultimate shame of being so. Hitler was a traitor to the human race and deserves to be placed in the same pantheon as the confererates. Its goddamn incredible that this point STILL needs to be made 150 years later. Jesus fucking Christ. Education and rational thinking has failed in many areas of this country___Its coming. And fast. Get your popcorn___Hell of a general, terrible human being, yet later in his life, disavowed the KKK and his former ideology. A true conundrum of a man.___Worst of all, closet ""muh HeRiTaGe"" racists. Fucking cowards.___Why would they want them? Who the fuck pays admission to see that scrap? No one.___You make no sense whatsoever. Hitler was a racist, hitler was not a traitor; therefore, a Hitler statue should be ok to stand in Germany. Log off and never post anything again. Idiot.___Doesnt matter. They acted in their time to openly and actively chose a side that engaged in open treason for all of the wrong reasons. The leaders of this cause should have hanged for their crime of treason outright. The course of the 150 years after would have looked quite different.___This is also what happens when concerted efforts of voting discrimination, gerrymandering, and all around toxicity has kept them in power long past their old, tired messaging has lived beyond its shelf life. The silent majority isnt who or what those dildos thought it was. People are fed up and tired of GOP incompetence.___They are not. They were put up during the Jim Crow era for one reason only. They are trash and should be scrapped. Fuck the ""heritage"" argument. The only heritage this dog whistle describes is the state rights to keep slaves. They wrote that themselves in the documents of succession in every state that seceded Fuck those traitors and their snake filled ""heritage"" bullshit.___The CSA openly rebelled against the compact of states bound by the constitution. They are traitors and were VERY specific in their reasoning when drafting their articles of secession. States right TO KEEP SLAVERY. Therefore, you are attempting to lionize men that fought battles against their own countrymen to keep an morally unjust economic and social construct in place. Which cost over 1million american lives by the time it was over. What a thing to be proud of......",nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
"You are speaking for yourself and the majority, yes. I live in the south as well. Racism is everywhere. But it is much much higher in the south. I lived in the PNW, Appalachia, Louisiana, texas, Germany, Kuwait, Iraq, etc. The only place I've lived more racist than the south is Kuwait. That is saying something too. The south is the breeding ground of the klan, and there's reason for that. It's because racism is institutional and prevalent in the south. Argue all you want, but it's alive and festering.___Um....I think you're replying to the wrong guy bud. I'm stating the south is the home of the confederacy and some hard ass racists. I know this, because I hear stupid racist shit from good ol boys every fucking day.___How is that racist? The stereotype of the racist southerner is there for a reason. You know, the motherfuckers that used to own and trade people? Those people were from the confederacy, aka the south. I live in the south, that trope is actively real.___Me too bud. I've been an F1 fan since I was a child. It's the pinnacle. Nascar always rubbed me wrong. I was always turned off by the deliberately racist ""good ol' boy"" club it attracted. But now that these good ol' boys can't bring their ""heritage"" flag, I'm in. I hope this attracts others like me to join the fan base.
